Everything becomes an outline of the thing. Objects become schemata. The world becomes a map of the world. An anhedonic can navigate, but has no location.

Just what is funny eludes you. You only know that, by looking at it all like a silly game you were never invited to play - or to reuse a metaphor, the gym class you're required to attend but not to enjoy, everything picks up an absurd tint and you begin to take small pleasure in little infractions of the rules. Every interaction with somebody is an opportunity to tell a small but plausible lie, or to reveal something embarrassing about yourself and log their reactions. And you're not making fun of these people, not even having fun at their expense. You're just enjoying, with some degree of scientific observation, the absurdity of it.",

It lets you understand a little bit more about different hopes, aspirations, dreams, and fears. It helps us to identify with the people who are sharing this journey with us.",
